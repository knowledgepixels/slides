- Can be reliably retrieved / referenced through hash-based identifiers (Trusty URIs, e.g. [http://purl.org/np/RASe3c2pjmN9TvAoxD_CZ-qBVhVMUk9dSMRHOOVxdXbqM](http://purl.org/np/RASe3c2pjmN9TvAoxD_CZ-qBVhVMUk9dSMRHOOVxdXbqM))
- Can be digitally signed
- Are linked to their creators (e.g. via [ORCID](https://orcid.org/))
- _Can be about anything_, e.g. domain-level links between genes/diseases/organisms/drugs/etc., data entries, metadata, reviews, comments, opinions, workflows, etc.
- New terms (concepts, relations, etc.) can be defined on the fly if needed

- _Decentralized and open network of servers_
- Layers of publishing services / querying services

<img src="https://nanodash.knowledgepixels.com/images/logo.svg" height="150px">

- Web interface to browse and search nanopublications
- and publish nanopublications via template-based forms
- Based on the services of the network (no local DB)
