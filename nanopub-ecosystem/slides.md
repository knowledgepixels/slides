- _Tiny packages of knowledge graph contributions_
- Encoded in machine-interpretable language (RDF)
- Come with provenance and metadata (also in RDF)
- Treated as individual independent publications

- _Decentralized and open network of servers_
- Layers of publishing services / querying services
- Has been up continuously for more than 10 years

- _Nanopublication client_
- Allows for browsing and searching nanopublications
- Allows for publishing nanopublication via template-based forms (which are defined as nanopublications too)
- Doesn't have any local database, but _gets all its data from the network_
