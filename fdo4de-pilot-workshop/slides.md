## Nanopublications

- Tiny packages of knowledge graph contributions
- Come with provenance and metadata
- Are treated as individual independent publications
- Are reliably referenced with cryptographic content-based identifiers (Trusty URIs)
- Can be digitally signed

---

## Nanopublication Updates

- Nanopublications are _immutable_ by definition (which is enforced by the content-based identifiers)
- To _update_ a nanopublication, a new nanopublication is published that declares to supersede the first
- To _"delete"_ a nanopublication, a new nanopublication is published that declares the first as retracted
