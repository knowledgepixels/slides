## What are Nanopublications?

- _Tiny packages of knowledge graph contributions_
- Come with provenance and metadata
- Treated as individual independent publications
- Reliably referenced with cryptographic content-based identifiers
- Can be digitally signed

**Example:**

## Updates and Collections

- Nanopublications are _immutable_ by definition
- To _update_ a nanopublication, a new nanopublication can declare to supersede or retract the first
- (Large) collections of nanopublications can be defined with index nanopublications pointing to collection members
