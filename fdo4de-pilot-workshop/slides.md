## What are Nanopublications?

- _Tiny packages of knowledge graph contributions_
- Come with provenance and metadata
- Treated as individual independent publications
- Reliably referenced with hash-based identifiers
- Can be digitally signed

**Example:**

## Nanopublications: Updates and Collections

- Nanopublications are _immutable_ by definition
- To _update_ a nanopublication, a new nanopublication can declare to supersede or retract the first
- (Large) collections of nanopublications can be defined with index nanopublications pointing to its members

## Nanopublication Ecosystem

- Decentralized and open network of servers
- Layers of publishing services / querying services
- Has been up continuously for more than 10 years
- Network monitor: [https://monitor.knowledgepixels.com/](https://monitor.knowledgepixels.com/)

## Nanopublication Client

- Allows for browsing and searching nanopublications
- Allows for publishing nanopublication via template-based forms (which are defined as nanopublications too)
- Doesn't have any local database, but gets all its data from the network
