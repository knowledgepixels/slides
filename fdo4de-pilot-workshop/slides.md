- Tiny packages of knowledge graph contributions
- Come with provenance and metadata
- Are treated as individual independent publications
- Are reliably referenced with cryptographic content-based identifiers (Trusty URIs)
- Can be digitally signed

_Example:_ [https://w3id.org/np/RAbNN09tl3ROzrXxOqYrtIcquEqcXWGvOki_2YPGc89xo](https://w3id.org/np/RAbNN09tl3ROzrXxOqYrtIcquEqcXWGvOki_2YPGc89xo)

## Updates and Collections

- Nanopublications are _immutable_ by definition
- To _update_ a nanopublication, a new nanopublication can declare to supersede or retract the first
- (Large) collections of nanopublications can be defined with index nanopublications pointing to collection members
