## Research Integrity Crisis

...

---

## Idea:

### _Can we tackle the problem BEFORE submission?_

<br><br>

Something like a _"research integrity CAPTCHA"_<br> or a _"journal entry visa"_?

---

## Proposed Solution:

### _Public Manuscript Registration_

- Mandatory public registration before submission to journal
- Minimal info: ORCID of main author + title of manuscript
- Journals may later add public notes, positive or negative, e.g. "all integrity checks passed" or "data not available"

---

## Goal

- Requirement for exposure of manuscript/author to negative flagging _keeps away bad actors from the start_

- _Possibility_ of flagging is sufficient (mostly): journals don't actually need to publish notes about manuscripts

---

## Integration:

### _Minimal/Manual_

- _Note on journal submission page:_ "Important: Register your manuscript here [link] before submission"
- Editors-in-chief check whether _new submissions are found on registration site_; if not send desk-rejects
- Editors-in-chief make sure for camera-ready papers that _author/ORCID of original registration is present_

or tighter/smoother integration via _**APIs**_
