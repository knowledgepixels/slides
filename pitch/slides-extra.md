## Ecosystem

We are building a new nanopublication-based ecosystem for knowledge sharing:

- _Decentralized:_ based on a global network of services
- _Open and anti-silo:_ everybody can join, and all data is open and accessed as a single global knowledge graph
- _Reliable:_ services are redundant and content is cryptographically verified

---

## Short-Term Business Model

- **Partners:**
  - Funds from research projects and innovation grants
  - _Value:_ Help research communities prepare their future communication technology
- **Researchers / Communities / Projects / Institutions:**
  - Free use of Nanodash
  - _Value:_ Fast, precise, and trustworthy knowledge updates; visibility and recognition in community

---

## Market Validation

Global spending on scholarly communication/technology:

- _$1 billion/year_ APCs (Article Processing Charges)
  - &gt; 502k Open Access articles/year
  - avg. $1626/article
- _$6 billion/year_ on journal subscriptions
  - &gt; 2 million articles/year
- _$50 billion/year_ on technology by universities

---

## Our Future

- _**Best-case scenario:**_ Our ecosystem revolutionizes scientific communication and we dominate this new market, with upwards of $100M of yearly revenue
- _**Realistic success scenario:**_ Our ecosystem is established in major scientific domains and we occupy a large share of the created market, with around $10M of yearly revenue
- **Worst-case scenario:** We keep providing semantic publishing services and expertise to innovative publishers like IOS Press and Pensoft

## Calculation Slides

### Calculations for Open Access

- 501 950 articles with APC published in 2019 (with article-level data in DOAJ) with avg. $1626/article [[source]](http://hdl.handle.net/10393/42327)
- Therefore $816 170 700 total APCs in 2019 (not counting articles not in DOAJ and hybrid journals)
- Conservative estimate: $1B/y total APCs of OA/hybrid journals combined

---

### Calculations for Journal Subscriptions 1/2

- Overall 2.9M articles/year in 2020 [[source]](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20214/publication-output-by-country-region-or-economy-and-scientific-field)
- Minus 500k+ OA articles gives >2M in subscription model

---

### Calculations for Journal Subscriptions 2/2

- No global data; New Zealand universities spend for biggest 4 publishers "around US$14.9 million in 2016 (the total spending on all publishers is likely at least 2-3 times that)" [[source]](https://theconversation.com/universities-spend-millions-on-accessing-results-of-publicly-funded-research-88392)
- Conservative estimate: NZ universities spend $30M/y on subscriptions contributing 0.5% of global share (NZ has 0.25% of global GDP)
- Therefore globally 6B/y spent on journal subscriptions

---

### Calculations for University Technology Spending

- $16B per year in US [[source]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/universities-spend-16bn-each-year-technology-hardly-any-barosevcic/)
- US share of global R&D is 28% [[source]](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20225)
- Assuming university tech expenses are proportional to R&D: global university tech expenses = $57B/year

---

### Calculations for Number of Researchers/Groups/Journals

**Researchers:**
- ~1 "article equivalent" per researcher and year [[source]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157715000218)
- 3M articles/y therefore means 3M active researchers

**Research groups:**
- group size is on average 7.3 [[source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465944/)
- Therefore ~400k research groups globally

**Journals:**
- ~30k globally; 28060 from largest 100 publishers [[source]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JD-04-2022-0083/full/html)

### Calculations for Realistic Success Scenario

**20% of 3M researchers (600k) use Nanodash**
- 18k paying users (3% conversion rate), paying on avg. $200/y (pro plan income is offset by discounts)
- _→ 3.6M/y revenue from researchers_

**20% of 3M articles/y (600k) in journals with Nanodash plan**
- $12/article (pro plan income is offset by discounts)
- _→ 7.2M/y revenue from journals_
