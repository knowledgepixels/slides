<h3>Pitch Deck</h3>
<p><small>under construction...</small></p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scientific knowledge and discourse are scattered, unstructured, and not interoperable</li>
<li>Existing approaches for organizing scientific knowledge (ResearchGate, ChatGPT, etc.)  are shallow and imprecise</li>
<li>Science is slowed down by this lack of efficient communication</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Solution:</h2>
<h3>Quick and Rich Knowledge Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Precise:</em> Machine-interpretable due to logic-based representation</li>
<li><em>Fast:</em> Created quickly due to minimal size, and disseminated quickly due to dedicated ecosystem</li>
<li><em>Trustworthy:</em> Trust through social network and through rich and detailed provenance of every single statement</li>
<li><em>Universal:</em> Can capture findings, studies, researchers, arguments, opinions, datasets, etc. of any domain
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Technology: Nanopublications</h2>
<p>Universal approach for all kinds of scholarly knowledge, based on small and provenance-aware data snippets:</p>
<img class="stretch" src="knowledge-record.png"/>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Ecosystem</h2>
<p>We are creating the knowledge space, an ecosystem to communicate science in a fast, precise, and trustworthy manner in small machine-understandable pieces (nanopublications).</p>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Product: Nanodash
- Platform to publish and view nanopublications, and to interact with scientific communities
- Nanopublication feeds (like Twitter, but machine-interpretable)
- Community pages (like Facebook or LinkedIn, but for research communities)
- Domain-level knowledge base (like Wikipedia, but machine-interpretable and coming directly from the researchers)
</section>

## Market Validation
Article Processing Charges (APCs):
- ~ 5 million papers published each year
- &amp;gt; 500k papers (rising trend) follow OA with APC model
- ~ 1 billion USD of total yearly APCs (avg. $1600/article)
<!--
Source: http://hdl.handle.net/10393/42327
501 950 articles with article-processing charges (APC) published in 2019, with USD 1626 per article on average.
Therefore USD 501950*1626 of total APCs in 2019.
But that only counts the journals that have summary statistics in DOAJ. And doesn't count APCs from hybrid journals.

University Technology Expenses:
- Universities globally spend $50 billion/year on technology
<!--
Source for US ($16B/year): https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/universities-spend-16bn-each-year-technology-hardly-any-barosevcic/
US share of global R&D (28%): https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20225
Assuming university tech expenses are proportional to R&D: global university tech expenses = $57B/year

## Potential Outcomes
- **best-case scenario:** Our ecosystem revolutionizes scientific communication and we dominate the market this creates, with upwards of $100M of yearly revenue
- **realistic success scenario:** Our ecosystem establishes itself in some large scientific domains and we occupy a large share of the created market, with around $10M of yearly revenue
- **worst-case scenario:** We keep providing semantic publishing services and expertise to innovative publishers like IOS Press and Pensoft
