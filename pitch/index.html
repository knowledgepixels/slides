<h3>Pitch Deck</h3>
<p><small>under construction...</small></p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scientific knowledge and discourse are scattered, unstructured, and not interoperable</li>
<li>Existing approaches for organizing scientific knowledge (ResearchGate, ChatGPT, etc.)  are shallow and imprecise</li>
<li>Science is slowed down by this lack of efficient communication</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Solution:</h2>
<h3>Quick and Rich Knowledge Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Precise:</em> Machine-interpretable due to logic-based representation</li>
<li><em>Fast:</em> Created quickly due to minimal size, and disseminated quickly due to dedicated ecosystem</li>
<li><em>Trustworthy:</em> Trust through social network and through rich statement-level provenance</li>
<li><em>Universal:</em> Can capture findings, studies, researchers, arguments, opinions, datasets, etc. of any domain
</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Technology: Nanopublications</h2>
<p>Universal approach for all kinds of scholarly knowledge, based on small and provenance-aware data snippets:</p>
<img class="stretch" src="knowledge-record.png"/>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Ecosystem</h2>
...
<!--
<p>We are creating the knowledge space, an ecosystem to communicate science in a fast, precise, and trustworthy manner in small machine-understandable pieces (nanopublications).</p>
-->
</section>

<section data-markdown>
## Product: Nanodash
- Platform to publish and view nanopublications, and to interact with scientific communities
- Nanopublication feeds (like Twitter, but machine-interpretable)
- Community pages (like Facebook or LinkedIn, but for research communities)
- Domain-level knowledge base (like Wikipedia, but machine-interpretable and coming directly from the researchers)
</section>

## Market Validation
University Spending Globally:
- $1 billion/year APCs (Article Processing Charges)
  - &amp;gt; 500k Open Access articles/year
  - avg. $1600/article
<!--
Source: http://hdl.handle.net/10393/42327
501 950 articles with article-processing charges (APC) published in 2019, with USD 1626 per article on average.
Therefore USD 501950*1626 of total APCs in 2019.
But that only counts the journals that have summary statistics in DOAJ. And doesn't count APCs from hybrid journals.
-->
- $6 billion/year on journal subscriptions
  - &amp;gt; 2 million articles/year
<!--
spending on New Zealand universities for journal subscriptions by four biggest publishers: "around US$14.9 million in 2016 (the total spending on all publishers is likely at least 2-3 times that)"
https://theconversation.com/universities-spend-millions-on-accessing-results-of-publicly-funded-research-88392
New Zealand is 0.25 percent of world GDP
Conservative estimate: $30M/y in New Zealand making up 0.5 percent of global share, therefore globally 6B/y.
Overall 2.9 million articles/year in 2020 (https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20214/publication-output-by-country-region-or-economy-and-scientific-field)
Minus 500k+ gives >2 million in subscription model
-->
- $50 billion/year on technology
<!--

US share of global R&D (28%): https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20225
Assuming university tech expenses are proportional to R&D: global university tech expenses = $57B/year

## Plans and Pricing
- **Nanodash for researchers (with group discounts):**
  - Free
  - Standard ($200/y/user)
  - Pro ($400/y/user)
- **Nanodash for journals (with discounts for large ones):**
  - Standard ($12/y/article; <1% of avg. APC)
