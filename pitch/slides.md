## Problem

- **Publishing of scientific knowledge and discourse is:**
  - _unstructured_ (narratives instead of knowledge graphs)
  - _disconnected_ (platforms only know about own content)  <!-- all major communication platforms used by researchers are data silos:  ResearchGate, Academia.edu, LinkedIn, Twitter -->
  - _slow_ (9-18 months from submission to formal publication)  <!-- source: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2013.09.001 -->
  	or _untrusted/unrewarded_ (blogs/social)
- **Consequences:**
  - _Researchers_ waste time and energy
  - _Society_ wastes money
  - _Everybody_ lacks scientific insights
<!--
- Existing approaches for organizing scientific knowledge (ResearchGate, ChatGPT, etc.)  are shallow and imprecise
- _Science is slowed down by this lack of efficient communication_
-->

---

## Solution:

### precise, fast, and trustworthy knowledge updates

- _Precision:_ Machine-interpretable due to logic-based representation
- _Speed:_ Created quickly due to minimal size, and disseminated quickly due to dedicated ecosystem
- _Trust:_ Trust through social network and through rich statement-level context

---

## Value Proposition

- **Researchers / Communities / Projects / Institutions:**
  - Communication with precision, speed, and trust
  - Visibility and recognition in communities
  <!-- - Credit for community-driven datasets -->
  <!--  - → time saved for staying up-to-date, AI-powered assistance, etc. -->
- **Publishers / Journals:**
  - Strong connection to research communities
  - Getting good papers/reviewers, visibility, reputation
  <!-- - Role as guardians of scientific communities and data -->
  <!-- - New economic opportunities in ecosystem -->
- **Everybody:**
  - Precise and trustworthy AI-powered reasoning on humanity's knowledge

---

## Ecosystem

We are building a new nanopublication-based ecosystem for knowledge sharing:

- _Decentralized:_ based on a global network of services
- _Open and anti-silo:_ everybody can join, and all data is open and accessed as a single global knowledge graph
- _Reliable:_ services are redundant and content is cryptographically verified

---

## Short-Term Business Model

- **Partners:**
  - Funds from research projects and innovation grants
  - _Value:_ Help research communities prepare their future communication technology
- **Researchers / Communities / Projects / Institutions:**
  - Free use of Nanodash
  - _Value:_ Fast, precise, and trustworthy knowledge updates; visibility and recognition in community

### Calculations for Open Access

- 501 950 articles with APC published in 2019 (with article-level data in DOAJ) with avg. $1626/article [[source]](http://hdl.handle.net/10393/42327)
- Therefore $816 170 700 total APCs in 2019 (not counting articles not in DOAJ and hybrid journals)
- Conservative estimate: $1B/y total APCs of OA/hybrid journals combined

---

### Calculations for Journal Subscriptions 1/2

- Overall 2.9M articles/year in 2020 [[source]](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20214/publication-output-by-country-region-or-economy-and-scientific-field)
- Minus 500k+ OA articles gives >2M in subscription model

---

### Calculations for Journal Subscriptions 2/2

- No global data; New Zealand universities spend for biggest 4 publishers "around US$14.9 million in 2016 (the total spending on all publishers is likely at least 2-3 times that)" [[source]](https://theconversation.com/universities-spend-millions-on-accessing-results-of-publicly-funded-research-88392)
- Conservative estimate: NZ universities spend $30M/y on subscriptions contributing 0.5% of global share (NZ has 0.25% of global GDP)
- Therefore globally 6B/y spent on journal subscriptions

---

### Calculations for University Technology Spending

- $16B per year in US [[source]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/universities-spend-16bn-each-year-technology-hardly-any-barosevcic/)
- US share of global R&D is 28% [[source]](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20225)
- Assuming university tech expenses are proportional to R&D: global university tech expenses = $57B/year

---

### Calculations for Number of Researchers/Groups/Journals

**Researchers:**
- ~1 "article equivalent" per researcher and year [[source]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157715000218)
- 3M articles/y therefore means 3M active researchers

**Research groups:**
- group size is on average 7.3 [[source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465944/)
- Therefore ~400k research groups globally

**Journals:**
- ~30k globally; 28060 from largest 100 publishers [[source]](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JD-04-2022-0083/full/html)

---

### Calculations for Realistic Success Scenario

**20% of 3M researchers (600k) use Nanodash**
- 18k paying users (3% conversion rate), paying on avg. $200/y (pro plan income is offset by discounts)
- _→ 3.6M/y revenue from researchers_

**20% of 3M articles/y (600k) in journals with Nanodash plan**
- $12/article (pro plan income is offset by discounts)
- _→ 7.2M/y revenue from journals_
